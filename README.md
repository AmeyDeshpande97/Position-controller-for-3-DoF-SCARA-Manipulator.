# Position-controller-for-3-DoF-SCARA-Manipulator.
The goal of this project is to develop and implement a joint space position control for a 3-DoF Revolute-Prismatic (RRP) robot manipulator. We implemented a position-based controller and incorporated  precise PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control for joint space tracking of the robot in the Gazebo.
